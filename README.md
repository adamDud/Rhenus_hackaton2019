# Rhenus_hackaton2019
## my solution to Rhenus hackaton 2019 using G1ANT 

the main goal was to create a robot that would check for the weather conditions for surfing in specified places around the world. Then it should make an excel file containing all the data collected, choose the best place for surfing (requirements specified in the task description) and send an email back containing the summary of the weather conditions in a chosen place and the excel file as an attachment.

repository contains the bpmn chart i made explaining how the robot works, screenshots of the results and the code (feel free to use it).
